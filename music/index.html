            <p>Taylor Swift is an artist who inspires me. She started from a small town in Pennsylvania and became one of the most famous musical artists ever. She explores a lot of different genres in her music, like pop, country, and indie folk. She plays piano and sings like me, and she also plays guitar which is a goal I have for the future. I think she is the most influential singer of this generation. </p>

            <p>Other artists that inspire me include Noah Kahan, Jordy Searcy, and Lizzy McAlpine</p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>I have preformed in countless concerts, recitals, and preformances for both singing and piano. I try to practice as much as I can and I take lessons for both voice and piano. I love listening to music becuase it calms me down and moivates me to get better at my own instruments.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>I want to get to the point in piano where I sightread and play any song I want, and maybe learn a concerto. For singing I want to improve my range and my tone, which will probably take a lot of practice. Another goal I have is to learn guitar so I can explore differernt genres of music.</p>

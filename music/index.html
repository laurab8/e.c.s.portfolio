            <p>Taylor Swift is an artist who inspires me. She started from a small town in Pennsylvania and became one of the most famous musical artists ever. She explores a lot of different genres in her music, like pop, country, and indie folk. She plays piano and sings like me, and she also plays guitar which is a goal I have for the future. I think she is the most influential singer of this generation. </p>
